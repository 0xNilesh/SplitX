## 🚀 What is SplitX?

**SplitX** is the easiest way to manage shared expenses in groups. Whether it's for trips, dinners, or shared subscriptions — SplitX helps you track who paid what, who owes whom, and lets you settle up seamlessly.

Built with Web3 under the hood, but feels like your favorite Web2 app.

## ✨ Why We Built on Xion

SplitX is powered by **Xion**, the first blockchain to offer **native account abstraction and gasless transactions**. That means:

- ✅ **No Wallets Required** – Onboard users with just an email or social login.
- ⚡ **Truly Gasless UX** – Users don’t need to hold or spend crypto.
- 🔐 **Security by Default** – Transactions are signed and secured via smart accounts.
- 🌎 **Web2-like Simplicity** – Anyone can use it, no crypto experience needed.

By building on Xion, we’re making Web3 *invisible*, so users can just enjoy the product.
